# Explainable Health Prediction with Transfer Learning
This is a project studied on the sick and normal faces classification with Transfer Learning. Explainble AI technique is applied to find the attributes of each decision.

## Experimental Results

## Model - VGGFace16
VGGFace16 model [1] is used in extracting the image's features before training.

## Explainable AI
